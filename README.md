# URcaps external control
Package for external control of a UR robot. It supports UR3, UR5 and UR10 of CB3 as well as the e-series.

## prerequisites
As this URCap is using swing to implement the user interface, the URCap library in version 1.3.0 or
higher is required. Therefore the minimal PolyScope versions are 3.7 and 5.1.

To enable external control of a UR robot from a remote PC, this URcap must be installed on the UR robot and the ur\_rtde\_driver has to be installed on the remote PC. 

## usage
* In the _Installation_ tab of Polyscope:
	* Adjust the IP address of your robot in the _Installation_ tab of Polyscope (this step might be unnecessary in simulation). 
* On the remote PC:
	* Launch the suitable _launch_ file for UR3/UR5/UR10 and CB3/e-series.
* In the _Program_ tab of Polyscope:
	* Add this URcap to a program by selecting it from the side menu under the tab _URcap_.
	* Execute the program by pressing the _play_ button in the _Program_ tab of Polyscope.

## troubleshooting

- make sure to have all paths and usernames updated in pom.xml
- Build instruction: mvn install -P ursim (ursim is a variable defined in pom.xml)
